This is an alternative housing that can be used for the guts of one of the pre-made injection molded Z endstops.
You will have to free the brass sleeve and pin. I found it easy to take a hotend to the IJ plastic then push it out.
You will have to desolder the switch and flip it. The one I bought used a knock off switch so I replaced it with an OMRON.
I found the pin to be a hair too short and replaced it with a slightly longer one to ensure the extruder would not hit the buildplate
The hole is offset to put the end stop in the correct position if you push the housing as forward on the Y extrusion as you can.
