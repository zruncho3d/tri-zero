# Servo Powered Docks for the V0 and Variants 

This as a mount for the z-probe that moveâ€™s the probe and dock out of the way while printing.
Therefore there is no loss on print volume !

# BOM Notes

| Part | Qty | Notes |

| Probe | Zero-Click or euklid | Tested on my Ghost LG toolhead |
| - | - | - |

| M3 x 6 | 1 | Pivot point for the main dock|
| M3 x 6 | 1 | To mount the servo base to the z-extrusion (top)|
| M3 x 35| 1 | To mount the servo base to the z-extrusion (bottom) |
| | | note that the mounting hole of the servo needs to enlarged to 3mm |
| M2 x 10 self-tapping | 2 | for the dock assembly |
| M3 Insert | 1 | Pivot point mount - use some Loctite here |

# Firmware

There are some configuration files and snippets in the firmware folder.
They are based on a Euklid probe mounted to a Ghost LG Toolhead. So physical dimensions need to be adjusted to your setup.

WARNING: while configuring your printer make sure that you don't run any z-homing routines with the probe or dock deployed.
It will likely kill your probe mount and maybe the servo gears (if you don't use a servo with metal gears)
(Don't ask me how i know)

# CAD  Notes

The CAD includes all variants in one file.
You need to show/hide the version you like to work with

Also note the Joints (Rotation and sliders) to animate and test the movements
