Unfortunately all V0.1 part except the panels need to replaced. 
There is also a new topdeck with mounts for a USB keystone and an optional chamber temp sensor.
The top deck is designed for CANBus cables. You need to enlarge the cable opening if you go with with a full cable tree.

## Build Notes

You need to V0.2 A/B Idler top blocks with the locking mechanism. 
I also use 3mm pin instead of screws for the front door hinge. This way i can simply detach the front door and open the tophat to print PLA and other materials that need a bit more cooling.

## Printing

Standard Voron settings

I used a Voron V2.4 250mm to print the one part tophat. You need to cut it in pieces if you only have a 120mm build volume.

The MGN front mount have some built-in break-away supports
