# Tri Zero mods by HBO

This is a collection of all my mods related to the Tri-Zero 3D printer from zruncho.
There are plenty of mods as my version shares only a few part with the original zruncho design.

I try to maintain a "Assembled" CAD to help putting all this mods together
### The assembled CAD might also include mods that are not yet released in any of the repos
